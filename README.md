# Python_oop
Implementing some of the oop (object-oriented programming) concepts using python 

History:
we could not implement functions in struct so we tended to make object or classes where we could use functions or methodes

Terminology:
Class: main container which include the properties of each object without certain values

object: specific item with the values of the described properties in the class

Encupslation: to separate the class not to direct access to the variables , check validation of the value , help classes not to contact directly , help in testing process
      setter: responsable function for changing or upgrading the value of a variable 
      getter: get the value of variable without changing it 

Abstraction: separate the code with only the necessary information to know 
      interface: share data ( output ) needed through getter methode with all classes 
      implementation: the specific steps of the code to reach the output and not accessed by the rest of the classes

Inhertance: collecting common features of more than one class and repreasent them in a seprate class (parent) with the first ones (child) inhert from it

Polymorphism: changing the appearance of a methode
      overwritting: repeat a methode with the same name in different classes with different values
      overloading: repeat methode in the same class with different parameters (types or number)
